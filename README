I would like Robin to:
- setup a basic django project
- create models and CRUD endpoint for the resources needed to implement the following functionalities:
  - user can create a `Book`: title, number_of_pages, author
  - user can read all books, but update/delete only their own
  - each book can have `Annotation`s with fields: page, text, annotation_author
  - user should be able to create a book and a few annotations in one request
  - user should be able to find books with and without their own annotations via query filter `?has_my_annotations=`
- They should write 2 unit and 2 integration tests
- They should use Git to log their work
- If they have doubts about the requirements, they should make a choice and motivate it with inline comments.
